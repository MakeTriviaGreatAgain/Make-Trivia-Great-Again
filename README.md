## Description

Finished group project#2: Interactive Full-Stack Application

Name: Make Trivia Great Again

Make Trivia Great again is an application that allows users to spin a wheel containing thirty trivia questions of five different categories: Geography, Mythology, Science, Sports, and [insert last category here] to test their trivial knowledge.

Users will be able to login with a username, email, and password so they can save their scores and track how well they perform.

## Installation

When the user loads the page, they will be prompted to sign up with a username, email, and password of their choice so their scores can be stored so they can track and try to beat their previous scores. Once the user signs up, they will be able to start the trivia by hitting the spin button on the wheel, randomly selecting a question. Once the question is answered, if correct, the user will get a point, if incorrect, no point will be added and the user will have to spin the wheel again to receive the next question until all the questions have been attempted. A perfect score will be thirty correct answers out of thirty questions.
